    <h1>Sensors</h1>
    <p>In IoT, sensors are used to collect data from various sources and send it to cloud-based platforms for analysis.

        The data collected by sensors are used to monitor and control various systems, including environmental conditions, traffic patterns, and equipment performance.
        
        For example, sensors in a smart home monitor temperature, humidity, and occupancy, and adjust the heating and cooling systems accordingly.
        
        Sensors are also used to track the location of assets, such as vehicles or inventory, in real-time.
        
        This allows businesses to optimize their supply chain and logistics operations by reducing inventory costs, improving delivery times, and increasing efficiency.</p>

        <h2>First Plant-Powered IoT Sensor Sends Signal to Space</h2>
        <p>The first-ever plant-powered sensor has successfully transmitted to a satellite in space. The pilot service, using plants as the energy source, has been developed by Plant-e and Lacuna Space. Because the sensor doesn’t need batteries, due to the internal storage in the system, it’ll reduce cost, maintenance requirements and environmental impact. As long as plants continue to grow, electricity will be produced.

            Combining the innovative energy harvesting technology developed by Plant-e with the extremely power efficient devices from Lacuna Space, these devices are completely self-sustainable and operate independent from sunlight, day and night.
            
            The Internet of Things (IoT) prototype device, developed by the two companies, uses the electricity generated by living plants to transmit LoRa® messages about air humidity, soil moisture, temperature, cell voltage and electrode potential straight to Lacuna’s satellite.</p>
