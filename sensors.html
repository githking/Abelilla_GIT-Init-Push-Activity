    <h1>Sensors</h1>
    <p>In IoT, sensors are used to collect data from various sources and send it to cloud-based platforms for analysis.

        The data collected by sensors are used to monitor and control various systems, including environmental conditions, traffic patterns, and equipment performance.
        
        For example, sensors in a smart home monitor temperature, humidity, and occupancy, and adjust the heating and cooling systems accordingly.
        
        Sensors are also used to track the location of assets, such as vehicles or inventory, in real-time.
        
        This allows businesses to optimize their supply chain and logistics operations by reducing inventory costs, improving delivery times, and increasing efficiency.</p>
