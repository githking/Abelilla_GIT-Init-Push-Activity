        Raspberry Pi is defined as a minicomputer the size of a credit card that is interoperable with any input and output hardware device like a monitor, a television, a mouse, or a keyboard â€“ effectively converting the set-up into a full-fledged PC at a low cost. This article discusses the Raspberry Pi models available today, their key features, and use cases.

    <h2>Raspberry Pi news</h2>
    <span>Update: June 20, 2019

        Well, as we now know, the Raspberry Pi 4 did in fact come out in 2019. Despite indications, and even a statement from the CEO of Raspberry Pi Trading, that there would be no Raspberry Pi 4 in 2019, it did in fact happen! We are pleased to be wrong about the previous prediction!
        
        Original article:
        
        Since the inception of the Raspberry Pi board in 2012, the little board has become the most popular small computer board for experimenters, hobbyists, educators and technology enthusiasts. As the board became more powerful with subsequent releases, it even found its way into scientific and industrial applications.
        
        We can thank the Raspberry Pi Foundation for its vision and initiative to make this happen. Originally created to promote teaching of basic computer science and programming, it has gone well beyond its creators' expectations.</span>
