    <h1>Arduino</h1>
    <p>
        Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

    <h2>Benefits of the Arduino Cloud in education</h2>
    <span>Technology is evolving almost as quickly in schools as it is in the real world. The Arduino Cloud is a pivotal tool in this, as it bridges coding, STEM, and Internet of Things (IoT) for educators.

        This dynamic platform isn't just any ordinary digital teaching aid - it's an all-in-one solution tailored for educators. With regular feature additions and scalability, it's designed to meet the diverse needs of STEM teachers in middle school, high school and beyond.</span>
